Wild Things: Development Version
==========
Developed for **Beta v. Spirited Giraffe - Update 5**

**WARNING:** This is the development build of Wild Things Starbound Survivalist MOD. This version of Wild Things is likely to contain bugs and possibly major game breaking 
bugs that potentially could corrupt your game universe or player data. If you are still comfortable using this build I would love to hear everyone's feedback concerning 
the progress just be sure to mention you are using the GitHub version and when you last downloaded it.

Installing
==========
Although you can download this entire repository from GitHub _I **do not** recommend downloading from GitHub_. I have created a [tool that creates .modpak and zips it up](http://community.playstarbound.com/threads/mod-distributor-batch-file.98289/) and more. Using this tool 
I am able to create a .modpak and zip it up fast for Dropbox distribution. I actually make the full push to GitHub after I done some basic in game test, so at times Dropbox may be more recently updated. Keep in mind all my work is done from the same one folder making work the same on Dropbox also. 

_Check Dropbox modified date and file name has the date for the latest versions,_

_**NOTE: **Checking the [live change log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hN_bAlULf0RDpMcpPWDsnuX-pAfdLkP0sU2qjAb1csY/edit) is the best way to keep up with the changes on the development version._

**TROUBLESHOOTING**
 - Remove previous versions of Wild Things before installing new versions.
 - I recommend removing the "_Starbound\giraffe_storage\player_ and _universe_" folders for a fresh start. Its not always required.
